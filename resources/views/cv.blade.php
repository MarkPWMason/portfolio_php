            <h2 class="subtitle">Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>During my college years, I grasped the fundamentals of programming, putting theory into practice with
                projects like a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter. As I transitioned to university, my focus shifted
                towards
                game development, where I delved into C#, C++, and Unreal Engine blueprints. Joining Frontier
                Developments
                broadened my skill set, exposing me to TypeScript, Preact, and SASS.

                Fueled by a preference for these languages, I took the initiative to independently learn JavaScript
                through
                Udemy. This effort resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the M.E.R.N stack, empowering me to
                develop
                both backend solutions in PHP/Laravel/Node and polished frontends using React/HTML/CSS/JS. Currently,
                I've
                embarked on a successful freelance career, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and my
                passion
                for delivering high-quality programming solutions. </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Education</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">Bachelors of Science: </span> Computer Games Design and Programming, 2019 - 2022</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Staffordshire University - </span> Stoke-On-Trent </p>
            <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree with a focus on Computer Games Design and Programming at Staffordshire
                University, achieving an Upper Second-Class Honours. My choice to pursue this field stems from a genuine
                love for playing and creating video games. Throughout my academic journey, I gained a solid grasp of the
                fundamentals required for crafting games. Importantly, I also acquired programming skills that extend
                beyond
                gaming, making me adept in various software applications. This dual proficiency positions me not only
                within
                the gaming industry but also in diverse software development opportunities.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Work History</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">Freelance Full Stack Developer </span> 03/2023 to Present</p>
            <p>In my freelance capacity, I actively engage with clients, directly discussing their product visions.
                Keeping
                clients informed about the progress and promptly addressing any changes is a key aspect of my role. My
                projects, crafted using a diverse set of programming languages like React, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP,
                Laravel, and Node, alongside foundational languages such as HTML and CSS, showcase my versatility. This
                experience has not only enhanced my proficiency as a web developer but has also bolstered my confidence
                and
                adaptability, making me more adept at acquiring new skills.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">UI Developer </span> 06/2022 to 10/2022</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Frontier Developments PLC - </span>Cambridge, Cambridgeshire</p>
            <p>In my role as a UI Developer, I collaborated with the design team to bring their concepts to life. I used
                TypeScript, Preact, and SASS for implementation. Regular communication with the gameplay team ensured we
                had
                accurate information to display the UI effectively. Working with TypeScript and Preact improved my
                programming logic, while SASS gave me the skills to style the UI as per the design team's preferences,
                including incorporating animations for a polished look.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Retail Assistant </span> 11/2021 to 03/2022</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Matalan - </span>Stoke-On-Trent, Staffordshire</p>
            <p>
                In my position at Matalan, I took charge of stock management and organization across the store. I also
                assisted at the tills, helping customers with their purchases. This role strengthened my teamwork and
                communication skills, which I successfully applied during my time at Frontier.</p>
